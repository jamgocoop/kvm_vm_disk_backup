1. Requirements

KVM kernel cappabilities and Virtual Machines running on it.

Below packages should be installed:

libvirt-bin lvm2 python

Script was tested with python 2.7.x. Should be ported to run on python 3.x

2. User and groups

The script needs to be run as root or a user that:

-Can create/remove Logical Volumes (LV)
-Can connect to libvirtd through socket. This tipically requires to belong to the same group that runs the libvirt process

3. Installation

If requirements and user/groups are satisfied, just pick an example from "examples" directory and test it

4. TODO

Implement the revert LV compressed backup method
